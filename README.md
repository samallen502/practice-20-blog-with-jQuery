This is not a functioning blog. This is more of a demonstration of how jQuery works, using a blog with a new feature being added for context.

See app.js for code with comments.

Ultimately, I learned that you can chain jQuery commands or, if you so desire, code how the chain appears to make your code human-readable (requires situational use of judgment).  I also learned that jQuery commands ike "fadeIn" override other commands like "slideDown", so not all jQuery animations "play nicely" with one another. Also important in jQuery is using the appropriate camelCase syntax; I had some bugs simply because I didn't respect the proper syntax out of ignorance!
